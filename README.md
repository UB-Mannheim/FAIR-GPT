# FAIR GPT

A documentation for [FAIR GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-BkMR28wlV-fair), an AI assistant focused on guiding researchers and data stewards in making their datasets compliant with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles.

## Features

FAIR GPT offers the following features:

- **Metadata Review and Recommendations:** Analyzes dataset metadata for compliance with international standards (DataCite, Dublin Core, Schema.org) and offers enhancements to ensure datasets are easily findable and identifiable.
- **Data Structure Guidance:** Provides advice on data organization, including naming conventions and file structures, to enhance data accessibility and usability.
- **Documentation Assistance:** Helps in creating detailed documentation that covers data collection, processing, anonymization, and usage, including exemplary readme files to accompany datasets.
- **Repository Recommendations:** Identifies appropriate data repositories for long-term storage, taking into account the subject area and specific data types, to ensure datasets are preserved in accessible and citable forms.
- **FAIR Principles Evaluation:** Employs advanced algorithms and external APIs to assess and score datasets' adherence to FAIR principles, offering a clear pathway toward improvement.
- **Customized Training and Education:** Provides tailored training sessions and educational resources on data management best practices, specific to the user's field or data type, promoting a deeper understanding of FAIR principles.
- **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Advises on linking dataset metadata with knowledge graphs like Wikidata, enhancing interoperability and the semantic enrichment of data.
- **Legal and Ethical Guidance:** Offers recommendations on licensing, data protection, and ethical considerations to ensure data sharing complies with legal standards and respects privacy.
- **Data Policy Consultation:** Assists organizations in developing or refining their data policies to support FAIR data management and sharing practices.
- **Data Paper Publication Support:** Recommends suitable data journals for publishing data papers, increasing the visibility and citation of datasets.
- **Interactive FAIRness Assessment Tool:** Includes an interactive tool for users to self-assess their datasets' FAIRness, providing instant feedback and actionable advice for each FAIR principle.
- **Data management planning:** Creates a data management plan using the metadata of data.
